The spot is marked by a hilly arch-like rock formation, which is the distinguishable landmark of the area. Set over the crashing waves of the open Indian Ocean, Broken Beach is a great spot for travel photographers and panoramic view seekers. The adjacent area is also home to grey long-tailed macaques. If you’re lucky, you may spot silhouettes of giant mantas near the surface of the deep blue water.",
